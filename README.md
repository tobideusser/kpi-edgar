# How to run

This repository lets you run the download, training, and evaluation process for the paper "KPI-EDGAR: A Novel Dataset 
and Accompanying Metric for Relation Extraction from Financial Documents", to be published in the proceedings of the 
IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications 2022. A preprint of the paper is available on 
[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09163).

First, install all required packages by running ***pip install /path/to/setup.py***, preferably in a virtual 
environment. NOTE: We used the most up-to-date branch of [fluidml](https://github.com/fluidml/fluidml) for this project,
so you likely have to install the branch "run-info-access" from source.

Then, download the data from the EDGAR database with the ***download_from_edgar.py*** located under the folder ***/scripts***.

Thereafter, kick of the training pipeline by adding the relevant folder to the config under the folder ***/config*** 
and executing the ***run_train_pipeline.py*** located under ***/scripts***.

# KPI-EDGAR dataset

If you simply want to download the KPI-EDGAR dataset, access the annotations and data from ***/data***. 
The most up-to-date dataset will always be called ***kpi_edgar.xlsx***.

In ***/data***, there is also a "pre-parsed" json file titled ***kpi_edgar.json***, which includes IOBES tags and might 
be easier to use for some.

# Test set performances
